description: Need an economical ride for family or work? Look no further than
  this nice 2016 Ford Escape SE. With less than 100,000 miles on the odometer,
  this is a vehicle that should last you a long time. It's got options like
  backup camera, bluetooth, alloy wheels, Sirius XM, and more. It's really clean
  inside and out. We just ran it through the shop here and everything checked
  out and the oil change is freshly completed. All 4 tires on it are almost new.
  Stop by and take it for a drive. Financing available and trades welcome.
