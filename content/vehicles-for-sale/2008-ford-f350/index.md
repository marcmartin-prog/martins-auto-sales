description: Nï»¿eed a tough truck for work or horsing around? We've got what you
  need in this 2008 Ford F350. It's a Lariat model, so has a lot of comfort
  options like heated leather, fog lights, sunroof, and more. Plus it's upgraded
  with a backup camera to make hooking up to a trailer a breeze. It's got the
  6.4 liter diesel engine in it and it's been deleted and tuned, so it has
  plenty of horses for work or play. The engine was fully rebuilt just over 3
  years ago, with the Bulletproof diesel upgrades to keep it from breaking
  again. It's been a southern vehicle all it's life, so no rust, and it's never
  seen an accident. It's a local truck here and can provide paperwork on the
  engine build and the maintenance that has been done. This truck has almost new
  rubber on it, which is worth around $3k. Stop by and take it for a drive! This
  is a smooth-running, hardworking truck. Financing available and trades
  welcome.
