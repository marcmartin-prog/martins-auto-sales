description: Check out this fantastic 2016 Ram 2500! This remarkable truck is
  equipped with a formidable 6.7-liter Cummins engine and an automatic
  transmission. It has been emissions deleted and tuned, with a 5-position tune.
  Additionally, it comes with an EfiLive AutoCal device, allowing you to
  effortlessly change tunes whenever desired. Experience its exceptional
  performance as it runs smoothly and possesses abundant power. Although it
  carries a rebuilt title due to a few dents and previous glass damage caused by
  a storm, it remains in decent condition and serves as an ideal choice for a
  farm or work truck and its 5th wheel towing ready.  Don't miss out on this
  opportunity; take it for a test drive today! Feel free to make an offer as I
  am open to negotiations.
