description: The Utility Shed is the most practical, economical choice for a
  portable storage shed that doesn’t have the look of a barn. This outdoor
  storage shed will give you the most for your money. It also can be the storage
  place for all the tools, bikes, and yard decor you don’t want to keep in your
  garage. Add shelves and a garden tool hanger to better utilize your walls for
  more storage space.
