description: Check out this beautiful 2017 Ford F250. This truck is set up great
  for towing, with the 6.7 Diesel engine, 360 degree camera, gooseneck hitch,
  and auxiliary air bags already installed. It's been deleted and tuned, with a
  5-position shift on the fly tune. Relax in the heated seats, and enjoy the
  8-inch radio and other options. The CP3 pump has just been replaced with a new
  one from Ford. It's got no leaks and no engine lights on, so it's ready to
  hook up to a trailer or just have fun. It's never seen a wreck and has only
  223k one-owner miles. Stop by and drive this truck today. It's in great shape
  all around. Financing available and trades welcome.
