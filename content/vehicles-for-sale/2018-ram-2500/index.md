description: Here's a truck that's ready to go to work for you. 2018 Ram 2500
  Tradesman 4WD. It's powered by the 6.7 Cummins engine, and has a long bed,
  with a gooseneck trailer hitch already installed and auxiliary air bags on the
  rear so it can tow and haul whatever you need. It's already been deleted and
  tuned, so it'll have no emission system to fail on you. It's got no fluid
  leaks, and the tires still have a lot of life left on them.  From front to
  rear, it's just a tough truck for whatever you want to throw at it. Priced
  below book value, it won't last long! Financing is available.
