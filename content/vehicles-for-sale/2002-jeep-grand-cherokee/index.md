description: 2ï»¿002 Jeep Grand Cherokee for sale. Body is in good shape for the
  year. Would be a perfect ride for off-roading and having fun. Runs and drives
  good. I am selling this vehicle on consignment, so would be as is. Does need a
  bit of work to the A/C and front end. Looks great in the black Laredo package.
  Come take it for a test drive today! Open to offers on the price.
