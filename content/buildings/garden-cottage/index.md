description: The Garden Cottage is our newest design, and comes with all the
  designs one would expect for a storage shed to place in the backyard along the
  garden. Windows allow this Portable building to be used for potting, and the
  shutters create a cottage look. The overhang comes standard to protect the
  siding from water and the ridge ventilation keeps the building cooler. If you
  need a storage building but don’t want the shed look, this is the building for
  you.
