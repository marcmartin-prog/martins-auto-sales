  <p>Main Street Auto was founded on a vision to be a blessing to our town here in Strawberry. Our goal is to honor God most of all in our business relationships, and be here to work with family.</p>
  <p>My name is Marcus Martin, and I founded Main Street Auto in 2023. I grew up working on cars, and after moving to Arkansas in 2018, I worked for my brother in his shop. I got into fixing up wrecked cars on the side, and as it seemed to expand, my dream of having my own little dealership and service center grew. Especially after our son Jerrick was born in 2021, it pulled a lot to be able to work here at home with my family. In 2023, things finally came together to buy land and build a shop. Business began in May. We're here to serve the small community of Strawberry as best we can.</p>
  <p>While we are just a small business, it's great to be part of a small-town community. We greatly appreciate the business you've given us and it is truly an honor to be part of this community. </p>
